# Question Answering Model with SQuAD

## Overview

This project implements a Question Answering model using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). It leverages a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to extract answers from given contexts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch datasets
   ```

3. **Run the Model**:
   - Load the SQuAD dataset.
   - Use the provided Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to train and test the model.

## Example Usage

```python
custom_context = "Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes."
custom_question = "What is Artificial Intelligence?"
# Get answer from the model (implementation details in the notebook)
```
